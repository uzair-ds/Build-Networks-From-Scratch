## Transformer Implementation from Scratch

In this repository, we've implemented the Transformer architecture from scratch. The Transformer is a groundbreaking model that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning in general. Here are some key details about our implementation:

- **Transformer Architecture:** Our code includes a complete implementation of the Transformer model, as introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.

- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** We've implemented the self-attention mechanism, a critical component of the Transformer, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence for each position.

- **Positional Encoding:** To provide the model with positional information, we've included positional encoding as described in the original paper.

- **Multi-Head Attention:** Our implementation also includes multi-head attention, enabling the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.

- **Encoder and Decoder Stacks:** We've built both the encoder and decoder stacks to demonstrate how the Transformer can be used for tasks like machine translation, text generation, and more.

- **PyTorch Implementation:** Our code is written in PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, making it accessible for those familiar with PyTorch.
